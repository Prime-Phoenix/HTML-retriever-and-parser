# HTML-retriever-and-parser
Obtains HTML from targeted website, also parses it for links.

**This project is just the bare bones for a generic retriever and parser.
**I will make a branch of this which will get all user uploaded images from deviant art.

I would reccomend to use this as a skeleton and build your parser on top of this.
There are comments in the code to guide yo on how to do so.
